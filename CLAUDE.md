# Key-Value Memory Network Implementation Progress

## Project Overview
Implementing a Key-Value Memory Network for question answering using Wikipedia biography data. The system uses attention mechanisms to match questions with relevant key-value pairs in a database.

## Architecture Components
1. **KVMemNet Class**: Core neural network with embedding layers A and B
2. **Synthetic Data Training**: Test on small 20-word vocabulary dataset
3. **Full Data Training**: Train on Wikipedia biography dataset
4. **Question Answering**: Process natural language queries

## Implementation Tasks
- [x] KVMemNet class with proper attention mechanism
- [x] Synthetic data training loop with loss convergence
- [x] Data preprocessing for real dataset
- [x] Full training loop with train/test split
- [x] Natural language question processing

## Completed Implementation

### KVMemNet Class (Part B)
- Implemented neural network with embedding layers A and B
- Layer A: embeds questions, keys, and values
- Layer B: embeds all database values for training targets
- Forward pass computes attention scores and weighted value combination
- Handles both single examples and batched processing

### Synthetic Data Training (Part C)
- Created training loop for 20-word synthetic vocabulary
- Implemented proper loss computation with CrossEntropyLoss
- Used Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling
- Training shows convergence with loss reduction over epochs

### Real Data Processing (Part D)
- Created question templates for 15 common biographical relations
- Implemented train/test split with 80/20 ratio
- Built key-value pair selection mechanism
- Created Y matrix containing all possible answer values
- Implemented training loop with batch processing and periodic evaluation

### Question Answering (Part E)
- Entity extraction from natural language questions
- Relation detection using keyword pattern matching
- Relevant key-value pair selection from database
- Answer prediction using trained model
- Text reconstruction from bag-of-words predictions

## Key Technical Details
- Uses bag-of-words representation for questions/keys/values
- Attention mechanism: softmax(q Â· k) applied to values
- Layer A: embeds questions, keys, values
- Layer B: embeds all database values for target matching
- Single-hop retrieval (can extend to multi-hop)

## Notes
- GPU training with CUDA support
- Batch processing with bmm() for proper batching
- CrossEntropyLoss for training
- Cosine similarity for final answer selection
